# CDD Onboarding

This project handles Polymesh Customer Due Dilligence (CDD) claims, which are required to onboard and interact with the chain.

CDD claims ensure every participant of the Polymesh chain has completed some form of Know your customer / Know your business (KYC/KYB) process. Every address needs to be asociated to a CDD claim before it can receive the POLYX token or other Assets.
